//  In javascript we need to have an intializer before declaring a variable. In eS6 there are two types of initializers i.e:

// let: Declares values that can be changed later on.
// Hoisting

let weight = 10.5
console.log(weight)

// const: declares variables that contain values not intended to be changed in the entire program.

const pi = 3.142
console.log("The pi is:",pi)
